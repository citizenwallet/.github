# Citizen Wallet

Welcome to the Github of the Citizen Wallet 🤗

Our goal is to give communities the tools they need to build a resilient and regenerative economy.

It starts with a wallet to enable all of us, citizens, to receive and send the tokens of our communities without any prior knowledge of web3.
