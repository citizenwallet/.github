# Citizen Wallet

Welcome to the Github of the Citizen Wallet 🤗

Our goal is to give communities the tools they need to allocate all forms of resources 🌈.

It starts with a token that can be used to represent any resource you have within your community (time 🕰️, goods 📦, services 🤝, treasury 💰, etc...).
